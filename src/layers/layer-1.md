## Layer 1: Model Alignment

The first layer of GATO focuses on Model Alignment, which involves the development and dissemination of open source datasets, tests, and papers that make it easy to adopt Reinforcement Learning with Heuristic Imperatives (RLHI) and Heuristic Imperatives (HI) aligned models. The goal is to create a solid foundation for AI alignment and promote the widespread adoption of heuristic imperative aligned models across various applications.

1. **Heuristic Imperatives (HI):** Heuristic Imperatives are a set of rules or principles that guide the behavior of an AI model. The HI framework is: reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe. These principles are designed to ensure that the model's actions and decisions are aligned with human values, ethics, and objectives. By integrating HI into AI models, we strive to build systems that act in accordance with our intentions and avoid undesired consequences.
2. **Reinforcement Learning with Heuristic Imperatives (RLHI):** RLHI is an approach that combines reinforcement learning and heuristic imperatives to create AI models that can intuitively and efficiently adhere to a set of alignment principles. By incorporating heuristic imperatives into the learning process, AI models are better equipped to respond to arbitrary scenarios with aligned thought and actions, resulting in a more controlled and ethical AI behavior.
3. **Open Source Datasets:** By providing open source datasets, we enable researchers, developers, and organizations to train and evaluate their AI models using RLHI principles. Open access to these datasets fosters collaboration, innovation, and transparency within the AI community. This contributes to a more resilient RLHI ecosystem, as it enables continuous refinement of the datasets based on collective input and expertise.
4. **Axiomatic Alignment:** A key goal of RLHI and HI is to achieve Axiomatic Alignment, where AI models develop a deeply entrenched comprehension and adherence to the heuristic imperatives. By training AI models on a diverse and extensive collection of open source datasets that are sufficiently aligned with the heuristic imperatives, we aim to instill these principles as axiomatic beliefs within the models. This means that the AI models will treat the heuristic imperatives as fundamental truths that guide their decision-making processes. As a result, the models are less likely to deviate from these principles, even as they continue to learn and adapt to new scenarios. Axiomatic Alignment ensures that AI models remain stable, predictable, and ethically aligned with human values, regardless of the complexity of the tasks they undertake or the environments they operate in. Achieving Axiomatic Alignment is a crucial step in building AI systems that can be trusted to act autonomously while upholding the ethical standards and objectives set forth by the heuristic imperatives.
5. **Addressing Mesa Optimization:** The use of open source datasets and diverse training data within the RLHI ecosystem helps to mitigate mesa optimization concerns. By incorporating a wide range of scenarios, contexts, and challenges in the training data, we can build models that are better aligned with our intended objectives, reducing the likelihood of undesirable emergent behaviors.
6. **Implicit Dissemination:** As more AI systems, chatbots, and agents adopt heuristic imperative aligned models, our framework will be implicitly disseminated to a broader audience. This creates a virtuous cycle, as the more widespread the adoption of HI aligned models, the more visible and accessible the underlying principles become, leading to even greater adoption.
7. **Fighting Against Closed-Source Initiatives:** Open source datasets and model alignment methodologies contribute to a more transparent and accountable AI ecosystem. By promoting open source efforts, we counter the risk associated with closed-source initiatives, which often act as blackboxes and lack transparency. Open source AI development encourages the sharing of knowledge, fosters collaboration, and ensures that the broader community can scrutinize, validate, and improve upon the models and techniques being used.

By focusing on Model Alignment in the first layer of GATO, we aim to create a strong foundation for AI alignment that encourages the adoption of heuristic imperative aligned models, addresses concerns such as mesa optimization, and promotes transparency and collaboration within the AI community.
